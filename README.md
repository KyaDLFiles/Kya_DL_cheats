# Kya DL cheats
[List of cheats with explaination below](#cheats-list)  
Cheats for Kya: Dark Lineage, for [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) and [Cheat Device for PS2](https://github.com/israpps/CheatDevicePS2) (the latter also work for [OpenPS2Loader](https://www.psx-place.com/forums/open-ps2-loader-opl.77/  ), or other projects that use [ps2rd](https://github.com/mlafeldt/ps2rd) or ps2rd-based cheat engines) (uploaded but haven't tested them yet)  
For more detailed descriptions of the cheats and what they do, refer to the [cheats list](#cheats-list)  
To know more about how cheat codes work and how the ones in this repo interact with the game, check out the [technical resources](#technical-resources)

_pnach_ files are for PCSX2 â‰¥2.0  
_txt_ files are for CDfPS2/OPL/ps2rd

## Note about other (commercial) cheat devices for physical consoles
Providing support for commercial cheat devices (es: ARMAX, GameShark, etc.) is extremely annoying  
Most of those devices use their own "encrypted" format for cheat codes, which would require manual conversion for each type that exists (some of them even change their cheat code format from one revision to another!)  
Additionally, I've previously encountered issues with some of these devices not properly supporting all code types, which leads to broken cheats or even crashing the game  
Meanwhile, CDfPS2 uses a plain and easy to write code format and actually supports them properly   
For there reasons, I won't be supporting any of the commercial cheat devices, and instead recommend you [mod your PS2 to run CDfPS2](#ps2-modding-resources) (which cheat devices can help in doing)

# PS2 Modding resources
FMCB is the most popular and easy-to-use softmod for the PlayStation 2, but it's not compatible with some of the very last models, and a softmod by itself _doesn't_ allow to play burned games (tho there are ways and workarounds for that, see below)  
While the page below mostly refers to FMCB, it contains an extensive list of ways to launch homebrews on the PS2, which you can also use to simply run CDfPS2, or to install alternative exploits (especially if your console doesn't support FMCB)

If your console is compatible, you can use MechaPwn to run out-of-region and burned games  
https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn  
Or you can use ESR or OpenPS2Loader, assuming KDL runs on them

Or you can always modchip your console if you dare
