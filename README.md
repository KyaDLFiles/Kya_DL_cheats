# Kya_DL_cheats
Cheats for Kya: Dark Lineage, for [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) and [CheatDeviceForPS2](https://github.com/israpps/CheatDevicePS2) (to be added)

_pnach_ files are for PCSX2,  the ones with the longer filenames are for the 1.7 nightly builds, while the other ones are for legacy builds

## Note about PCSX2
It is recommended, even by the developers of the emulator themselves, to use the latest 1.7 nightly builds  
I'm also providing cheat files for older versions if you really have to use them, but since those versions don't have any sort of cheat management system, you'll have to edit the files and manually remove the cheats you don't want

## Note about other (commercial) cheat devices for physical consoles
Providing support for commercial cheat devices (es: ARMAX, GameShark, etc.) is extremely annoying  
Most of those devices use their own "encrypted" format for cheat codes, which would require manual conversion for each type that exists (some of them even change their cheat code format from one revision to another!)  
Additionally, I've previously encountered issues with some of these devices not properly supporting all code types, which leads to broken cheats or even crashing the game  
Meanwhile, CDfPS2 uses a plain and easy to write code format and actually supports them properly   
For there reasons, I won't be supporting any of the commercial cheat devices, and instead recommend you mod your PS2 to run CDfPS2 (for example with [FMCB](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6434#p6434), which cheat devices can actually aid in installing)
